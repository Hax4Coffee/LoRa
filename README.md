Research and Scripts on LoRa tech for offensive security purposes

LoRa (Long Range) technology, typically used for low-power, long-range IoT communications, can be exploited by hackers in several ways to compromise networks:

1. Jamming & Denial of Service (DoS)
•	Jamming Attacks: Since LoRa operates in unlicensed ISM bands (e.g., 915 MHz in the U.S., 868 MHz in Europe), attackers can use high-power transmissions to jam legitimate LoRa communications.
•	Flooding Attacks: Attackers can flood a LoRa gateway with excessive fake packets, overloading the network and causing legitimate communications to fail.

2. Sniffing & Passive Eavesdropping
•	LoRa transmissions are typically unencrypted by default unless AES encryption is implemented.
•	Attackers can deploy software-defined radios (SDRs) or LoRa sniffing tools (e.g., RPi with LoRa modules) to intercept unencrypted communications.
•	Extracting sensitive data such as sensor readings, control commands, or authentication tokens.

3. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks
•	Replay Attacks: If devices do not implement proper encryption and authentication, attackers can capture and replay packets to trigger actions remotely (e.g., unlocking a smart door, activating industrial sensors).
•	Packet Injection: Hackers can forge LoRa packets to send false commands or inject malicious payloads into IoT systems.

4. Exploiting Weak Authentication
•	Many LoRa devices lack proper authentication mechanisms.
•	Attackers can impersonate legitimate devices by spoofing their unique identifiers (DevEUI, AppEUI, etc.).
•	This can lead to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or control over IoT devices.

5. Exploiting LoRaWAN Protocol Vulnerabilities
•	Weak Key Management: LoRaWAN uses AES-128 for encryption, but poor key management (e.g., hardcoded keys, weak key exchange) makes it susceptible to key extraction.
•	Over-the-Air Activation (OTAA) Interception: Attackers can intercept Join Requests and inject malicious responses to hijack network sessions.
•	Abuse of Adaptive Data Rate (ADR): Malicious manipulation of ADR settings can degrade network performance or increase power consumption on victim devices.

6. Physical Attacks on End Devices
•	Firmware Extraction: If an attacker gains physical access to LoRa devices, they can dump firmware, extract encryption keys, and reverse-engineer device logic.
•	Side-Channel Attacks: Power analysis or fault injection can reveal cryptographic secrets used in LoRa communications.

Mitigation Strategies
•	Use End-to-End Encryption: Ensure AES-128 encryption is correctly implemented.
•	Authenticate Devices Properly: Use robust authentication mechanisms beyond just DevEUI/AppEUI.
•	Monitor for Anomalies: Implement intrusion detection to identify unusual LoRa traffic patterns.
•	Use Secure Boot & Firmware Protections: Prevent unauthorized firmware extraction or modification.
•	Limit Privileges: Ensure IoT devices have minimal access to critical systems.
